New business 
============
1. Explore running the simulations using SUMO GUI by using the following command: 
/c/Users/user/src/veins-5.2/bin/veins_launchd -vv -c /c/Users/user/src/sumo-1.8.0/bin/sumo-gui.exe 
instead of
/c/Users/user/src/veins-5.2/bin/veins_launchd -vv -c /c/Users/user/src/sumo-1.8.0/bin/sumo.exe

2. Follow SUMO beginner tutorials to understand how SUMO works and how to create various SUMO scenarios at:

ACTION: sih39

3. Explore and understand the backend files when example simulation runs. 
- You can explore files under samples/veins/src/veins/modules/application/ directory
- You can use "std::cout" to print on IDE console and "EV_INFO" to print on OMNeT++ console
- Try to create new functions of onBSM inside RSU and vehicle applications and play with them to handle things differently.
