Matters arising 
===============
1. Generate csv file of neighbor information.
- Create a new static global data structure (e.g., map or something else) and store the neighbor information of vehicles into it whenever local neighbor_table gets updated (e.g., new nb added or existing nb is removed due to timeout).
- At RSU[0],create a timer for a fixed interval (e.g., 1 second) and add records of each vehicle's neighbors into it. 
- CSV should have three columns (vehicle name, list of vehicle's neighbors names, simulation time [simTime])
