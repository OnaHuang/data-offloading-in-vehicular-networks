Status: No longer needed
When a vehicles leaves the network, its finish function is called. When we try to send a message (e.g., leaving network message), then it is not broadcasted in the network because the vehicle has left the network. Therefore, it would be better if neighboring vehicle came to know that the vehicle is no longer a neighbor with neighbor timeout timer.
