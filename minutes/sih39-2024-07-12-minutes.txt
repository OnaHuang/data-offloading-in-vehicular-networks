1. Implement the neighbor table containing node ids and last beacon received time.
i.e., everytime a vehicle/RSU received a beacon from its neighbor (vehicle/RSU), add the node and beacon received time into the neighbor table if the node does not exist in the neighbor table. Otherwise, if the node exists in the neighbor table, then update the last beacon received time.
