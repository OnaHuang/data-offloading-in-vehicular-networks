Matters arising 
===============
1. Explore running the simulations using SUMO GUI by using the following command: 
/c/Users/user/src/veins-5.2/bin/veins_launchd -vv -c /c/Users/user/src/sumo-1.8.0/bin/sumo-gui.exe 
instead of
/c/Users/user/src/veins-5.2/bin/veins_launchd -vv -c /c/Users/user/src/sumo-1.8.0/bin/sumo.exe
ACTION: sih39
Status: Done

2. Follow SUMO beginner tutorials to understand how SUMO works and how to create various SUMO scenarios at:
https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/index.html
ACTION: sih39
Status: Done

3. Explore and understand the backend files when example simulation runs. 
- You can explore files under samples/veins/src/veins/modules/application/ directory
- You can use "std::cout" to print on IDE console and "EV_INFO" to print on OMNeT++ console
- Try to create new functions of onBSM inside RSU and vehicle applications and play with them to handle things differently.

New business 
============
1. Install OMNeT++ 5.5.1 and try to run the veins code available at https://github.com/yasirsaleem/vanet-required-metrics repository.

3. Investigate running a simple SUMO network (hello world scenario) and try to faimilarise yourself about how things work in OMNeT++ and veins.

4. Search some reserach papers on trust management in vehicular newtorks, read their abstract, introduction, conclusion and go through the papers. Then shortlist the papers which are more relevant to you. 
Some keywords to consider are: 
- Trust management in Internet of Vehicles
- Trust management in IoVs
- Trust management in vehicular networks
- Trust management in vehicular ad hoc networks
- Trust management in VANETs
- Trust management in Intelligent Transportation Systems
- Trust management in ITS
